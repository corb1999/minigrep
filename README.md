[LINK](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)

to run it, type in terminal... `cargo run the poem.txt`
this command will run the program (cargo run), and search for the word (in this example 'the') within the file (here the file is a text file called 'poem.txt'). 'the' and 'poem.txt' are the two arguments using by the program.
